# SoundMaker
Thanks for giving the sd card you ask me to test. Here's what I notice:
It boots up with our first keypad screen.
It allows me to press a button and sound a beep.

If this sd card contains the new BSP then it's a step forward. So please continue to:
1. If it works with QML-Viewer then please document the steps to make the Linux starts the QML-Viewer.
2. If there is any changes needed to the Viewer please document the build process to create the Viewer.
3. If there is any changes needed to the beep.c please write it up too.
4. Now for testing please change to mainview.qml to play two different sound files without the need of button press.
5. Once you know this item 4 works then make it plays two sound files by toggling it with two buttons.

I think these would be helpful explorations. You can talk to Ken briefly so he knows we are checking out the audio and the new BSP.
